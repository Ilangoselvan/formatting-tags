			<h1>value of time</h1>
			<p>

			<b>Time</b> is more precious than <strong>money</strong> is. Once the <i>money</i> is used, it can be <mark>earned again</mark>, but the time which has passed will <em>never</em> return. <u>We all must have heard the famous</u> proverb, <q>‘Time and Tide wait for none</q>.’ Time never waits for anyone or <sup>anything</sup>. In fact, we have to wait for the<sub> perfect time</sub>. There is a perfect time for everything; therefore, think about how precious it is, and utilise it ideally before time fails. People say money can buy everything, but money can never buy time for you. So, understand the value of <big>time</big> and use it <small>wisely</small>.<del>Time is essential for everyone.</del>
